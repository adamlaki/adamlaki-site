## Bite-Sized A11Y

A small project where you can find short and solid accessibility posts.**

### The Goal of the Project

The goal is to collect and give you (and us) concise posts about accessibility. It is also a personal notebook where I can learn and repeat what I know about a11y.

### The Rules

- Maximum length of 149 words.
- Title doesn’t count.
- Alt text doesn’t count.
- Code doesn’t count.

### About the Content-Length

Writing about something in just a maximum of 149 words is a double-edged sword. It makes it easier (less content) but more complicated to include everything you want. Hence the references (that you can find at the end of most posts) are essential. We encourage you to read and discover them too. Learning about accessibility is challenging; we thought creating a note-like post collection would be a good idea to start.
