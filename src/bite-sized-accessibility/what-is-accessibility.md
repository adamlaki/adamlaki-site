By accessibility, we mean the concept of designing any service (digital) product in a way that will be usable for everyone equally.

A11y is part of UX; how users interact and use our software is determined by its accessible features. Generally speaking, a simple, inclusive feature like a proper text contrast can help anyone read our content more easily.

Accessible design primarily focuses on the person with a disability, while inclusive designâ€™s (a sister paradigm) main goal is to create a solution that is usable for everyone in the first place.

- We want to make something inclusive or accessible because it is the right thing to do.
- We want to connect with more people and sell more products and services.
- Also, the equal right to information is a fundamental human right materialized in many laws, so we also want to avoid lawsuits.
