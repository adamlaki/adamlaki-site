Hello, my name is Adam Laki! I'm a passionate, accessibility-focused front-end developer. I develop with Gatsby, 11ty, and WordPress. I like to learn and try out new things in my field.

I'm a self-employed contractor who is usually available for new projects, so feel free to drop me an email ([info@adamlaki.com](mailto:info@adamlaki.com)) if you have a project idea. I work with [Gerg≈ë](https://twitter.com/_iamgergo), a talented Laravel and Vue.js developer. We also do multiple - mostly open-source - projects together.

## OSS

Right now, my biggest side-project is [Spruce CSS](https://sprucecss.com/), which is a simple CSS framework. It is a newer project, but I hope for the best.

I also participate in the design of [Root](https://root.conedevelopment.com/), a Laravel admin package.

I started to create a collection of small accessibility tips and tricks called [Bite-Sized Accessibility](https://bite-sized-a11y.com/).

## UI

I have a design background, and I still like to create UIs. Fortunately, I have the opportunity to design for paid projects and sketch a lot with our side projects.

I design in the browser, which I can't recommend enough. I require a little different skillset but can be as fast as anything.

## Front-end

I love HTML and CSS. I love how easy to learn them and how hard to master them. I also like that there is always a new thing to learn.

I often write vanilla JavaScript. We usually use Vue.js for our contractor work, but I started to learn to React (primarily because of Gatsby back in the day).

## Accessibility

I started to learn accessibility back in 2019 out of curiosity. It amazes me how big of an area it is. I very much like it and try to understand it day by day.
